# NeuronStep App

**NeuronStep (Mobile)** is the frontend that generates, validates, and analyzes educational curricula. Built for students, educators, content creators, and anyone who values structured learning, NeuronStep uses the "gpt-4o-mini" model to create dynamic course content and provide feedback. The app leverages educational frameworks like Bloom’s Taxonomy and Cognitive Load Theory to tailor learning experiences to the needs and preferences of users.
