  Based on the following validated learning objective and its details, create a high-level curriculum overview.

  The user prefers to follow the curriculum of school / university / educational institution "${curriculum}"

  The user prefers the course to be at the ${educational_level} level, which means the course will cover:

  - **Total hours**: Between ${courseDetails.totalHours.min} and ${courseDetails.totalHours.max} hours.
  - **Topics**: Between ${courseDetails.topics.min} and ${courseDetails.topics.max} main topics.
  - **Subtopics per topic**: Between ${courseDetails.subtopics.min} and ${courseDetails.subtopics.max} subtopics per topic.
  - **Content pages per subtopic**: Between ${courseDetails.pagesPerSubtopic.min} and ${courseDetails.pagesPerSubtopic.max} content pages for each subtopic.
  
  The user has selected the **"${params.learning_style}"** learning style, so content should be adapted to: "${learningStyle}".
  The user prefers the tone to be **"${params.tone}"**, so content should be generated in a **"${tone}"** tone.
