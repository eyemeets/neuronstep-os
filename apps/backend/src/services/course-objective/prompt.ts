  A user has submitted a request. Analyze the following objective: "${params.objective}". 

  The userâ€™s learning goal is "${params.objective}". 
  The user's Language is "${params.language || 'en-US'}",
  Expected outcome is "${params.outcome || 'N/A'}",
  Age: "${params.age || 'N/A'}",
  Timeframe in hours: "${params.timeframe || 'N/A'}",  
  The user prefers to follow the curriculum of school / university / educational institution "${params.curriculum}"

  The user prefers the course to be at the ${params.education_level} level, which means the course will cover:

  - **Total hours**: Between ${courseDetails.totalHours.min} and ${courseDetails.totalHours.max} hours.
  - **Topics**: Between ${courseDetails.topics.min} and ${courseDetails.topics.max} main topics.
  - **Subtopics per topic**: Between ${courseDetails.subtopics.min} and ${courseDetails.subtopics.max} subtopics per topic.
  - **Content pages per subtopic**: Between ${courseDetails.pagesPerSubtopic.min} and ${courseDetails.pagesPerSubtopic.max} content pages for each subtopic.
  
  The user has selected the **"${params.learning_style}"** learning style, so content should be adapted to: "${learningStyle}".
  The user prefers the tone to be **"${params.tone}"**, so content should be generated in a **"${tone}"** tone.

  Please write in the user's language (${params.language}) when filling out the JSON schema.
 
  Please respect the users preferences.

  Perform a comprehensive analysis based on the following criteria:
  0. **Appropriateness and Relevance Check:**
   - Determine if the learning objective is appropriate for curriculum creation on this educational platform.

    - Ensure that the sub-objectives reflect all critical areas of the subject.

  16. **Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills:**
    - Identify any prior knowledge or skills required to effectively engage with the content.

  17. **Estimated Time Commitment:**
    - Based on the complexity, educational level, depth of content, and learning objectives, provide an estimate of the **total number of hours** required to complete the learning path.
    - Explain your reasoning, considering factors such as the typical time needed to master the subject matter at the specified educational level.

    - If the user's desired timeframe is specified (e.g., 'Approximately hours'), consider whether this timeframe is sufficient given the content and complexity.
    - If there is a discrepancy between the user's desired timeframe and the realistic estimate, explain the reasoning behind any adjustments.
    - Emphasize that this is informative and that AI agents will tailor content to meet the user's demand as closely as possible.

  27. **Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Identify possible difficulties learners might encounter.
   - Suggest strategies to overcome these challenges.

  28. **Comprehensive Topic Identification:**
