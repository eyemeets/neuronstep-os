# NeuronStep Server

## NeuronStep Course Curriculum Generator

**NeuronStep** is an AI-driven course generation system designed for students, educators, course creators, and anyone interested in structured learning. By leveraging the "gpt-4o-mini" model, it creates, analyzes, and validates course objectives, curricula, and outlines. NeuronStep utilizes educational frameworks like Bloom's Taxonomy and Cognitive Load Theory, providing users with a structured, adaptive learning experience tailored to their needs.

## Features
- **Course Objective Validation**: Validate learning objectives against curricula and receive feedback on their suitability.
- **Course Analysis**: Perform deep analysis of validated learning objectives, ensuring alignment with educational standards, Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy, and learning styles.
- **Course Creation**: Automatically generate a detailed curriculum, including chapters, subtopics, and assessment strategies.
- **AI-Driven Feedback**: Adaptive learning recommendations and feedback are tailored to user inputs.
- **Modular Design**: Allows for highly customizable curricula generation.

- Node.js (v16+)
- `pnpm` as the package manager (Or any other)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eyemeets/express-ts-starter.git
   cd express-ts-starter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

3. Run the development server:
  ```bash
  pnpm dev
  ```

4. Build the project:
  ```bash
  pnpm build
  ```

## OpenAI API Key

1. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) to obtain an API key.
2. Add your API key to the `.env` file by setting `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

2. Add your API key to the `.env` file by setting `REPLICATE_API_KEY`.

### Auto File-Based Routing

This project uses `express-file-routing` to map files directly to routes. For example:

- **`src/routes/index.ts`** handles `GET /`
- **`src/routes/dynamic/[id].ts`** handles `GET /dynamic/:id`

To add a new route, simply add a new file to `src/routes/` and export route handlers like `get`, `post`, etc.

### Example: Add a New Route

1. Create a new route file:

   ```bash
   touch src/routes/hello.ts
   ````

2. Add a route handler:

  ```ts
  import { Request, Response } from 'express';

  export const get = (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
  };
  ```

3. Access the new route at GET /hello.

## API Usage

### 1. Course Objective Validation
This API validates a given learning objective and returns feedback, validation results, and suggestions.

- : **Endpoint** `POST http://localhost:3000/course-validator`

- **Request Payload**:
```JSON
{
  "objective": "I want to learn about AI",
  "lang": "en-US",
  "educationLevel": "undergraduate",
  "curriculum": "UIS",
  "learningStyle": "readingWriting",
  "tone": "academic"
}
```

### 2. Course Analysis
After the course objective has been validated, this API performs a detailed analysis of the course, including recommendations for improvement, learning styles, and educational frameworks.

- **Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:3000/course-analysis`

- **Request Payload**: Use the validated learning objective from the previous step.

- **Response**
```JSON
{
  "objective": {
    "valid": true,
    "reason": "The objective of learning about AI is broad but appropriate...",
    "curriculum": "UIS",
    "learning_outcomes": ["Understand core AI concepts", "Develop critical thinking skills"],
    "bloom_taxonomy_level": "Understanding",
    "cognitive_load_assessment": "The information can be structured to prevent overload...",
    "skills_21st_century": ["Critical Thinking", "Collaboration"],
    "learning_style": "readingWriting"
  },
  "plan": {
    "title": "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence",
    "description": "This undergraduate curriculum provides an in-depth exploration of artificial intelligence...",
    "estimated_total_minutes": 80,
    "learning_objectives": ["Understand core AI concepts", "Assess AI's impacts on society"],
    "key_focus_areas": ["AI technologies", "Ethical considerations", "Practical applications in industry"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Course Creation
This API generates a detailed curriculum structure based on the analyzed course objective and includes chapters, subtopics, and suggested content.

- **Endpoint**: `POST http://localhost:3000/course-creator`

- **Request Payload**: Use the analyzed course plan from the previous step.

- **Response**
```JSON
{
  "title": "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence",
  "description": "This undergraduate curriculum provides an in-depth exploration of artificial intelligence, including its foundational technologies, ethical issues, and real-world applications.",

      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

This project uses **Vitest** for unit testing.

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

Vitest is configured with TypeScript support and uses `ts-node/esm` to handle TypeScript files during tests. The tests are located in the `tests/` directory, and Vitest will automatically run all the test files.

### Example Test
Here‚Äôs an example of a basic test for the `GET /` route:

  ```ts
  import request from 'supertest'
  import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
  import app from '~/app.ts' // Use .ts extension explicitly

  describe('GET /', () => {
    it('should return hello world', async () => {
      const res = await request(app).get('/')
      expect(res.status).toBe(200)
      expect(res.body).toEqual({   hello: 'world' }) // Update to match the actual response
    })
  })
  ```

## Deploying to Vercel

You can deploy the app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

### Vercel Commands

Login to Vercel first
  ```bash
  pnpm v:login
  ```

To run the project locally with Vercel for development:

  ```bash
  pnpm dev:ship
  ```

To deploy the project to production:
```bash
pnpm ship
```
